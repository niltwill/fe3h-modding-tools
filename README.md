# FE3H - Modding tools

This is a collection of my modding tools for *Fire Emblem: Three Houses* (Nintendo Switch game modding), mostly in the form of Python scripts based on the [010 Editor binary templates](https://github.com/three-houses-research-team/010-binary-templates), with some bundled (compiled) apps.

What can you find here are scripts or tools that are not handled (easily or for batch operations) by the *010 Editor binary templates* or by using the GUI editors: [Triabolical](https://gamebanana.com/tools/13609), [Fodlan Editor](https://gamebanana.com/tools/8215), [Progenitor](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6902). Also, *010 Editor* is commercial software with a 30-day trial, so this is an alternative free option for modding the game.

For now, to prevent duplicating the same thing, I will focus on what's not available in the existing modding GUI editors/options. I also know that it might be more cumbersome to edit the JSON files, as you can't simply choose the enums from a list). Of course, I'll add most of the files later as time permits and I feel like working on it. Will probably also put the enums into different files and reference those later, reorganizing this whole modding environment. There will eventually be a GUI too for these different FE3H modding scripts/tools later, though first, the functionality needs to work in the CLI well enough before that. This is still a WIP environment here.
