# FE3H - Modding tools

This is a collection of my modding tools for *Fire Emblem: Three Houses* (Nintendo Switch game modding), mostly in the form of Python scripts based on the [010 Editor binary templates](https://github.com/three-houses-research-team/010-binary-templates), with some bundled (compiled) apps.
